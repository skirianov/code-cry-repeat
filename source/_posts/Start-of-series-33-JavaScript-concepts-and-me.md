## Intro

This is the first post of a series **"33 JavaScript concepts and me"**. The series have been inspired by [33-js-concepts](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts). Follow him on his twitter! [@leonardomso](https://twitter.com/leonardomso)

The JavaScript concepts sometimes may feel overwhelming to a begginers and even experienced devs. The goal of the series is to break them apart, get closer look at each of them and finally get the head around this topics. I want to make it less technical. I want people, who are willing to understand them will use only their imagination and no technical knowledge. 

This is my first experience of writing a blog and talking about technical things. Please do understand this and always refer to the official documentation and references like MDN.
